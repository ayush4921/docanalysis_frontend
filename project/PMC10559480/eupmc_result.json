The synthesis of DVGs in coronavirus has been suggested; however, the fundamental characteristics of coronavirus DVGs in gene expression and pathogenesis have not been systematically analyzed.<h4>Methods</h4>Nanopore direct RNA sequencing was used to investigate the characteristics of coronavirus DVGs in gene expression including reproducibility, abundance, species and genome structures for bovine coronavirus in cells, and for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 (a mouse coronavirus) in cells and in mice. The MHV-A59 full-length genomic cDNAs (~\u200931 kilobases) were in vitro constructed to experimentally validate the origin of coronavirus DVG. The synthesis of DVGs was also experimentally identified by RT-PCR followed by sequencing. In addition, the alterations of DVGs in amounts and species under different infection environments and selection pressures including the treatment of antiviral remdesivir and interferon were evaluated based on the banding patterns by RT-PCR.<h4>Results</h4>The results are as follows: (i) the structures of DVGs are with diversity, (ii) DVGs are overall synthesized with moderate (MHV-A59 in cells) to high (BCoV in cells and MHV-A59 in mice) reproducibility under regular infection with the same virus inoculum, (iii) DVGs can be synthesized from the full-length coronavirus genome, (iv) the sequences flanking the recombination point of DVGs are AU-rich and thus may contribute to the recombination events during gene expression, (v) the species and amounts of DVG are altered under different infection environments, and (vi) the biological nature of DVGs between in vitro and in vivo is similar.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The identified biological characteristics of coronavirus DVGs in terms of abundance, reproducibility, and variety extend the current model for coronavirus gene expression. In addition, the biological features of alterations in amounts and species of coronavirus DVGs under different infection environments may assist the coronavirus to adapt to the altered environments for virus fitness and may contribute to the coronavirus pathogenesis. Consequently, the unveiled biological features may assist the community to study the gene expression mechanisms of DVGs and their roles in pathogenesis, contributing to the development of antiviral strategy and public health.", "affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, 40227, Taiwan.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"grantId": "109-2313-B-005 -013 -MY3, 110-2327-B-005 -003 and 111-2327-B-005 -003", "agency": "National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan, R.O.C.", "orderIn": "0"}}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Animals"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Mice"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Murine hepatitis virus", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Coronavirus", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Coronavirus Infections"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "RNA, Viral", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Biology"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Genome, Viral"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Pathogenesis", "Coronavirus", "Gene Expression", "Defective Viral Genome", "Coronavirus Genome Structure"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": [{"name": "Antiviral Agents", "registryNumber": "0"}, {"name": "RNA, Viral", "registryNumber": "0"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12985-023-02189-7"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-023-02189-7"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10559480"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10559480?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": ["gen", "refseq"]}, "dateOfCompletion": "2023-11-02", "dateOfCreation": "2023-10-06", "firstIndexDate": "2023-10-07", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2023-10-09", "dateOfRevision": "2023-11-02", "electronicPublicationDate": "2023-10-06", "firstPublicationDate": "2023-10-06"}
