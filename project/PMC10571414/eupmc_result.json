however, their biological characteristics have not yet been experimentally validated in vitro and in vivo.<h4>Methods</h4>To comprehensively determine the amounts, species and structures of noncanonical transcripts for bovine coronavirus in HRT-18 cells and mouse hepatitis virus A59, a mouse coronavirus, in mouse L cells and mice, nanopore direct RNA sequencing was employed. To experimentally validate the synthesis of noncanonical transcripts under regular infection, Northern blotting was performed. Both Northern blotting and nanopore direct RNA sequencing were also applied to examine the reproducibility of noncanonical transcripts. In addition, Northern blotting was also employed to determine the regulatory features of noncanonical transcripts under different infection conditions, including different cells, multiplicities of infection (MOIs) and coronavirus strains.<h4>Results</h4>In the current study, we (i) experimentally determined that coronavirus noncanonical transcripts were abundantly synthesized, (ii) classified the noncanonical transcripts into seven populations based on their structures and potential synthesis mechanisms, (iii) showed that the species and amounts of the noncanonical transcripts were reproducible during regular infection but regulated in altered infection environments, (iv) revealed that coronaviruses may employ various mechanisms to synthesize noncanonical transcripts, and (v) found that the biological characteristics of coronavirus noncanonical transcripts were similar between in vitro and in vivo conditions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The biological characteristics of noncanonical coronavirus transcripts were experimentally validated for the first time. The identified features of noncanonical transcripts in terms of abundance, reproducibility and variety extend the current model for coronavirus gene expression. The capability of coronaviruses to regulate the species and amounts of noncanonical transcripts may contribute to the pathogenesis of coronaviruses during infection, posing potential challenges in disease control. Thus, the biology of noncanonical transcripts both in vitro and in vivo revealed here can provide a database for biological research, contributing to the development of antiviral strategies.", "affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, 40227, Taiwan.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "109-2313-B-005 -013 -MY3", "agency": "National Science and Technology Council, R.O.C.", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "110-2327-B-005 -003", "agency": "National Science and Technology Council, R.O.C.", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "111-2327-B-005 -003", "agency": "National Science and Technology Council, R.O.C.", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Animals"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Mice"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Murine hepatitis virus", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Coronavirus", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Coronavirus Infections"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "RNA, Messenger", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "RNA, Viral", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Pathogenesis", "Coronavirus", "Gene Expression", "Coronavirus Genome", "Noncanonical Transcript"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": [{"name": "RNA, Messenger", "registryNumber": "0"}, {"name": "RNA, Viral", "registryNumber": "0"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12985-023-02201-0"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-023-02201-0"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10571414"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10571414?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": ["gen", "refseq"]}, "dateOfCompletion": "2023-11-01", "dateOfCreation": "2023-10-12", "firstIndexDate": "2023-10-13", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2023-10-16", "dateOfRevision": "2023-11-01", "electronicPublicationDate": "2023-10-12", "firstPublicationDate": "2023-10-12"}
