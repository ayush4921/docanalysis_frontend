To experimentally validate the synthesis of noncanonical transcripts under regular infection, Northern blotting was performed. Both Northern blotting and nanopore direct RNA sequencing were also applied to examine the reproducibility of noncanonical transcripts. In addition, Northern blotting was also employed to determine the regulatory features of noncanonical transcripts under different infection conditions, including different cells, multiplicities of infection (MOIs) and coronavirus strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In the current study, we (i) experimentally determined that coronavirus noncanonical transcripts were abundantly synthesized, (ii) classified the noncanonical transcripts into seven populations based on their structures and potential synthesis mechanisms, (iii) showed that the species and amounts of the noncanonical transcripts were reproducible during regular infection but regulated in altered infection environments, (iv) revealed that coronaviruses may employ various mechanisms to synthesize noncanonical transcripts, and (v) found that the biological characteristics of coronavirus noncanonical transcripts were similar between in vitro and in vivo conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The biological characteristics of noncanonical coronavirus transcripts were experimentally validated for the first time. The identified features of noncanonical transcripts in terms of abundance, reproducibility and variety extend the current model for coronavirus gene expression. The capability of coronaviruses to regulate the species and amounts of noncanonical transcripts may contribute to the pathogenesis of coronaviruses during infection, posing potential challenges in disease control. Thus, the biology of noncanonical transcripts both in vitro and in vivo revealed here can provide a database for biological research, contributing to the development of antiviral strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12985-023-02201-0.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>Noncanonical transcript</kwd><kwd>Pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>Gene expression</kwd><kwd>Coronavirus genome</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Science and Technology Council, R.O.C.</institution></funding-source><award-id>109-2313-B-005 -013 -MY3</award-id><award-id>110-2327-B-005 -003</award-id><award-id>111-2327-B-005 -003</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par32">Coronaviruses (CoVs), which belong to the family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, order <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, are common contagious pathogens of humans and animals, causing widespread and costly diseases, including COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. CoVs are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with the largest known viral RNA genomes,&#x02009;~&#x02009;30 kilobases (kb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The genome consists of a cap, a 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR), open reading frames (ORFs), a 3&#x02032; UTR and a 3&#x02032; poly(A) tail. The 5&#x02032; two-thirds of the genome contains two ORFs (ORF 1a and ORF 1b) that encode 15&#x02013;16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), and the other one-third of the genome consists largely of genes encoding structural and accessory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">During coronavirus infection, in addition to synthesis of the coronavirus genome (referred to as coronavirus replication), a 3&#x02032;-coterminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) are also produced (in referred to as coronavirus transcription), from which structural and accessory proteins are translated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Synthesis of the sgmRNA in coronaviruses requires a discontinuous step guided by a conserved transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) motif, which is located immediately downstream of the leader sequence (TRS-L) and upstream of each structural and accessory protein-encoding gene (TRS-B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. TRS-L, which is located at the 5&#x02032; terminus of the coronavirus genome, shares high sequence identity with TRS-B. TRS-L acts as an acceptor for the complementary TRS-B donor sequence during sgmRNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] through a similarity-assisted copy-choice mechanism. Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that, in addition to the genome, longer sgmRNAs can also serve as templates for the synthesis of shorter sgmRNAs, extending the coronavirus transcription mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A subsequent study experimentally identified the leaderless genome and sgmRNAs in bovine coronavirus (BCoV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These results indicated that there are unidentified sgmRNAs with various structures in infected cells.</p><p id="Par34">The defective viral genome (DVG) is a mini version of the viral genome because it consists of a deleted virus genome synthesized presumably through a recombination process. DVG has been identified in most RNA viruses during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In coronaviruses, few DVG (or defective interfering RNA) species have been experimentally identified, including bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and mouse hepatitis viruses (MHVs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Because these previously identified DVGs in coronaviruses contain <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements required for gene expression in their 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; termini, they are employed as surrogates for the&#x02009;~&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kb full-length genome in studies on coronavirus replication, transcription and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">In addition to the well-known coronavirus genomes and sgmRNAs described above, other coronavirus RNA species, which are collectively referred to as noncanonical transcripts, have been suggested. However, their biological features have not yet been experimentally characterized in cell cultures and animals. In the current study, with the assistance of nanopore direct RNA sequencing, the synthesis of coronavirus noncanonical transcripts was experimentally validated, and the biological features were characterized in cell cultures and animals. The identification of the biological characteristics of coronavirus noncanonical transcripts may assist the coronavirus research community in obtaining insights into coronavirus gene expression and pathogenesis and provide a database for a variety of biomedical studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Viruses, cells and animals</title><p id="Par36">The Mebus strains of BCoV (GenBank: U00735.2) and MHV-A59 (GenBank: NC_048217.1) were obtained from David A.

The BCoV transcripts consisted of one or more genome fragments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C), and the gene sequences of the fragments were identical to those from different portion(s) of the full-length genome. In addition, the BCoV transcripts could be divided into two main categories, canonical transcripts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E) and noncanonical transcripts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F), with various quantities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D), based on the difference in sequence elements and the potential synthesis mechanisms. The canonical transcripts were well-established canonical coronavirus sgmRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E) with a leader sequence derived from well-defined canonical TRS-Bs (cTRS, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A) located immediately upstream of each structural and accessory protein-encoding gene and are thus defined as canonical sgmRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E).

In addition, it has been suggested that during coronavirus replication, a defective viral genome (DVG), which is a truncated version of the genome, can be synthesized irrespective of TRSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Consequently, based on whether the structures of noncanonical transcripts are relevant to TRSs, noncanonical transcripts were categorized into 2 subcategories: noncanonical sgmRNAs and DVGs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>F).

For synthesis of canonical sgmRNAs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A), coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) initiates (&#x02212;)-strand sgmRNA synthesis, attenuates at the canonical TRS-B, switches the template to the TRS-L and acquires the leader to synthesize the (&#x02212;)-strand sgmRNA from which the (+)-strand canonical sgmRNA with the leader is made. For the (+)-strand canonical sgmRNA without the leader (&#x00394;L_cTRS_sgm, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B), it is speculated that, if coronavirus RdRp does not switch the template and dissociate near or at the canonical TRS-B, the synthesis of the (&#x02212;)-strand leaderless-canonical sgmRNA from which the (+)-strand canonical sgmRNA without the leader is made occurs (&#x00394;L_cTRS_sgm, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B).

For 5&#x02032;3&#x02032;DVG (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E and F), coronavirus RdRp may initiate (&#x02212;)-or (+)-strand synthesis at one end of the genome using the (+)-or (&#x02212;)-strand as a template, respectively, switch the template(s) and acquire the sequence at the other end, synthesizing 5&#x02032;3&#x02032;DVG with sequence elements from 3&#x02032; UTR and 5&#x02032; UTR. Based on the current knowledge that the sequence elements from 3&#x02032; UTR and 5&#x02032; UTR harbor replication-required <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, it is assumed that DVGs without sequence elements from 3&#x02032; UTR and 5&#x02032; UTR cannot replicate; thus, (+)-strand DVGs are the end products. Consequently, it is speculated that when coronavirus RdRp internally initiates (+)-strand synthesis using the (&#x02212;)-strand genome as a template and acquires the sequence at the 3&#x02032; UTR to finish (+)-strand synthesis with or without template switching, (+)-strand &#x00394;5&#x02032;DVG with a 3&#x02032; but lacking a 5&#x02032; UTR is produced (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>G). In line with this mechanism, the sequence or secondary structure to which RdRp binds may serve as an initiator. On the other hand, coronavirus RdRp uses the (&#x02212;)-strand genome as a template, initiates (+)-strand synthesis at the 3&#x02032; end of the (&#x02212;)-strand genome, synthesizes the (+)-strand with or without template switching and dissociates from the (&#x02212;)-strand template to acquire a poly(A) tail, synthesizing (+)-strand poly(A)-containing &#x00394;3&#x02032;DVG with a 5&#x02032; but lacking a 3&#x02032; UTR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H). Finally, when coronavirus RdRp internally initiates (+)-strand synthesis using the (&#x02212;)-strand genome as a template and then dissociates from the (&#x02212;)-strand template to acquire a poly(A) tail, (+)-strand &#x00394;5&#x02032;3&#x02032;DVG with a poly(A) tail but without sequence elements from 3&#x02032; UTR and 5&#x02032; UTR is synthesized (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>I).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Noncanonical coronavirus transcripts are experimentally validated and are largely reproducible</title><p id="Par49">Based on the in silico analysis by nanopore direct RNA sequencing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), it was suggested that noncanonical coronavirus transcripts can be synthesized. To experimentally validate the results, in addition to genome and canonical sgmRNAs, other coronaviral transcripts (that is, noncanonical transcripts) were also synthesized during infection, and as a complementary method, the Northern blotting assay, which can be used to directly detect and quantitate RNA without further processing, was employed. With the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled primer probe BCoVN&#x02009;+&#x02009;(Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, left panel), in addition to signals representing the genomes and canonical sgmRNAs, multiple signals with different sizes and intensities were also observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, middle panel, denoted by blue brackets). Furthermore, the amounts of multiple signals increased with the time of infection.

Consequently, it is hypothesized that, based on the RNA patterns detected by Northern blotting assay, whether the species and amounts are altered under different infection conditions can then be determined. We first tested whether noncanonical transcripts were reproducible when the same HRT-18 cells were infected with BCoV from different passages or origins.

The BCoV-p95 isolate (GenBank: OP296992.1) is a BCoV variant with an altered genome structure of 106 nucleotide mutations obtained from the supernatant of HRT-18 cells persistently infected with BCoV and was used as an inoculum (VP0 BCoV-p95) in this experiment. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D, right panel, it was found that (i) the species of noncanonical transcripts differed between VP0 and VP 4 and (ii) the species of noncanonical transcripts were similar among VP4, VP5 and VP6 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D, right panel), but the amounts were different (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2C). By comparison of the genome structure between BCoV and the variant BCoV-p95, it was found that 47 nucleotides in BCoV were mutated from AU to GC and 41 nucleotides from GC to AU. Some of these mutations also occurred around the recombination points during the synthesis of noncanonical transcripts. Consequently, based on a previous study showing that AU-rich sequences can affect recombination efficiency and thus the synthesized RNA species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], mutation may be one of the reasons for the different patterns of RNA species found between BCoV and BCoV-p95. Consequently, the results suggest that both the species and amounts of noncanonical transcripts varied among different virus passages of BCoV-p95-infected HRT-18 cells.</p><p id="Par54">Together, the results suggest that the species or/and amounts of noncanonical transcripts can be regulated under different infection conditions, including (i) coronavirus inoculum isolated from different cells (BCoV from HRT-18 cells vs. HBCoV from HEK-293T cells, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), from different environments (BCoV from HRT-18 cells vs. BCoV-p95 from HRT-18 cells with persistence, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D) and from different passages (VP0-VP1, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B; VP0-VP6, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D), (ii) coronavirus inoculum with altered genome structure (BCoV-p95, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D) and (iii) coronavirus inoculum with different MOIs (0.1 vs. 10, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>The biological features of noncanonical coronavirus transcripts in vitro and in vivo are similar</title><p id="Par55">To examine whether the characteristics of noncanonical transcripts in vivo are similar to those in cells, the same amounts of sample acquired from MHV-A59-infected ML cells and MHV-59-infected mouse liver were used for nanopore RNA direct sequencing. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, the relative amounts of MHV-59 transcripts synthesized in the liver were low (~&#x02009;0.4% of total cellular RNA) in comparison with those in ML cells (~&#x02009;35% of total cellular RNA). In addition, MHV-59 transcripts from both ML cells and the liver consisted of 1 or more fragments, and the gene sequences of the fragments were identical to those from different portions of the full-length genome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). Although the amounts of MHV-A59 transcripts in the liver were relatively low, further analyses suggested that noncanonical transcripts can also be synthesized in the liver of MHV-59-infected mice, as evidenced by the number of reads for each transcript from mouse liver and ML cells infected with MHV-A59 shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1.

In conclusion, noncanonical coronavirus transcripts can also be synthesized in vivo. In addition, the biological features of noncanonical coronavirus transcripts were similar between in vitro and in vivo conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par57">Due to the diverse structures and lengths of noncanonical coronavirus transcripts, their synthesis has not been experimentally validated, nor has their biology been revealed both in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, the synthesis of coronavirus noncanonical transcripts was suggested by nanopore direct RNA sequencing and experimentally validated by Northern blotting. Their biological features were also experimentally characterized. The limitations and biological significance of the study are discussed below.</p><p id="Par58">Nanopore direct RNA sequencing is an excellent tool that allows us to comprehensively determine the abundance and diverse structures of coronavirus RNA species, especially those with low copy numbers and without previously identified sequences as references for analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, because SuperScript&#x02122; III reverse transcriptase (cat No. 18080044, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), which is optimized to synthesize first-strand cDNA of up to&#x02009;~&#x02009;12&#x000a0;kb, was used for nanopore direct RNA sequencing, the results may not cover all coronavirus transcripts, especially those with longer sizes. On the other hand, Northern blotting, which can detect viral RNA without amplification, could be used to experimentally detect the coronavirus transcripts of different lengths, including the&#x02009;~&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kb full-length genome. In addition, RNA detected by Northern blotting can be visualized and quantitated. However, the Northern blotting results did not specify the corresponding population of the noncanonical transcripts. Thus, to comprehensively determine the abundance and structures of specific coronavirus RNA species, especially those with low copy numbers and without previously identified sequences as references for analysis, nanopore direct RNA sequencing was employed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). On the other hand, if the experiments are conducted simply to examine whether, in addition to the genome and canonical sgmRNAs, other coronaviral RNA species (that is, noncanonical transcripts) can also be synthesized (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and to simply examine whether the overall amounts and species of noncanonical transcripts are altered under different infection conditions based on the RNA patterns (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), in addition to nanopore direct RNA sequencing, Northern blotting can also be employed. Consequently, it is suggested that with nanopore direct RNA sequencing and biochemistry tools such as Northern blotting, the landscape and biological features of coronavirus noncanonical transcripts can be more comprehensively determined.</p><p id="Par59">It has also been suggested that the synthesis of sgmRNAs without a leader is correlated with the TRS and the structure near the TRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Consequently, it is speculated that the difference in the number of TRSs (and their variants) and structures between the BCoV and MHV genomes, which can lead to the synthesis of sgmRNAs with or without leader sequences, may be the factor determining the synthesis of different portions of sgmRNAs between BCoV (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D) and MHV (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Furthermore, due to the large size of the coronavirus genome (~&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kb) and technical limitations such as reverse transcriptase, it is possible that reverse transcriptase reads long viral RNA transcripts for cDNA synthesis and dissociates halfway, leading to the synthesis of many incomplete reads with missing sequences at the termini. This leads to the question of how the missing leader and terminal sequences of transcripts can be identified from the nanopore sequencing reads. As described in the results, based on whether the 5&#x02032; terminal sequence is relevant to the TRS, the transcripts are classified into TRS-relevant transcripts and TRS-irrelevant transcripts (that is, DVGs). In terms of the transcripts (&#x00394;L_cTRS_sgm, &#x00394;L_ncTRS_sgm, &#x00394;5&#x02032;DVG and &#x00394;5&#x02032;3&#x02032;DVG) lacking 5&#x02032; terminal sequences, including the leader sequence, if the transcripts had no 5&#x02032;UTR sequence but contained the sequences positioned within the 50 nucleotides of cTRS-B or ncTRS-B at their 5&#x02032; termini, they were classified as &#x00394;L_cTRS_sgm and &#x00394;L_ncTRS_sgm, respectively; in contrast, if the transcripts lacked the 5&#x02032; UTR sequences and their 5&#x02032; terminal sequences were not relevant to the TRS, the transcripts were classified as &#x00394;5&#x02032;DVG or &#x00394;5&#x02032;3&#x02032;DVG. On the other hand, according to the synthesis mechanism of sgmRNA, it was defined during the classification (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) that the synthesis of sgmRNA must contain 3&#x02032; UTR. Consequently, in terms of the transcripts (&#x00394;3&#x02032;DVG and &#x00394;5&#x02032;3&#x02032;DVG) lacking a sequence from 3&#x02032; UTR, if the transcripts contained partial or complete 5&#x02032; UTR sequences but lacked the 3&#x02032; UTR sequence, the transcripts were classified as &#x00394;3&#x02032;DVG; if the transcripts lacked both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTR sequences, the transcripts were classified as &#x00394;5&#x02032;3&#x02032;DVG. Consistent with this, the synthesis capability of reverse transcriptase can also explain why an elevated proportion of &#x00394;5'DVG was observed in BCoV-infected HRT-18 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D), MHV-59-infected ML cells and mouse liver (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C).</p><p id="Par60">Based on the results shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, under regular coronavirus infection with the same BCoV inoculum and cells, the synthesis of noncanonical transcripts is reproducible overall. Thus, the biological characteristics of abundance and reproducibility (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) further highlight the biological significance of noncanonical transcripts during coronavirus infection. On the other hand, it was also found that the species and amounts of noncanonical transcripts were regulated under different infection conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that coronaviruses may have the potential to regulate the species and amounts of noncanonical transcripts in response to altered infection conditions for viral fitness, and such regulatory roles may also play important roles in pathogenesis. In addition, because noncanonical coronavirus transcripts can also be synthesized in vivo, identification of the function of noncanonical transcripts derived in vivo is also a priority in further understanding their roles in coronavirus pathogenesis in vivo. Consequently, the current results may provide further opportunities for studying the biological functions of noncanonical transcripts and the mechanisms by which coronaviruses regulate the synthesis of noncanonical transcripts. The outcomes of these studies may contribute to the development of antiviral strategies.</p><p id="Par61">Of the coronaviral RNA synthesis mechanisms illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, most require a copy-choice template-switching recombination step. In addition, recombination between coronavirus RNA species during natural infections has been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Since there are substantial amounts of noncanonical coronavirus transcripts synthesized during infection, recombination between noncanonical transcripts and the error-prone largest known RNA genome may assist coronaviruses in overcoming error catastrophe and thus restoring the fitness of the genome under selection pressure. Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that the longer coronaviral RNA transcript with TRSs can serve as a template for shorter sgmRNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, the longer canonical or noncanonical sgmRNAs with TRSs identified in the current study may be templates for shorter sgmRNA or/and DVG synthesis. Similarly, longer DVGs with TRSs could also be templates for the synthesis of shorter sgmRNAs and/or shorter DVGs. Accordingly, such a strategy may relieve the pressure on the genome and increase the species variety of noncanonical transcripts.</p><p id="Par62">In this study, we (i) experimentally determined the synthesis of noncanonical transcripts, (ii) demonstrated that the species and amounts of noncanonical transcripts are largely reproducible during regular infection but can be regulated under altered infection environments and (iii) found that the characteristics of noncanonical transcripts in vivo are similar to those in cell culture. The biological significance based on the findings is as follows: (i) classification of experimentally validated noncanonical transcripts extends the current model for coronavirus gene expression; (ii) synthesis of a variety of noncanonical transcripts may assist the coronavirus genome in overcoming error catastrophe via its recombination with the transcripts under harsh environments; and (iii) the regulated noncanonical transcripts in terms of species and amounts under different environments may have the potential to contribute to the pathogenesis of coronaviruses. Consequently, the identified biological characteristics of noncanonical coronavirus transcripts may lead to further research questions, including (i) what are the molecular mechanisms driving the synthesis of noncanonical transcripts? (ii) How are noncanonical transcripts regulated in response to altered infection conditions? (iii) How do alterations of populations in noncanonical transcripts impact virus evolution and adaptation to new hosts? (iv) How do host factors impact the synthesis and activity of noncanonical transcripts? Although the current study on coronavirus noncanonical transcripts may pose challenges in the control of coronavirus diseases, the answers obtained from the aforementioned studies may contribute to the development of antiviral strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par63">In the current study with BCoV and MHV-A59, we experimentally validated the synthesis and biological characteristics of noncanonical coronavirus transcripts both in vitro and in vivo. The identified features of noncanonical transcripts in terms of abundance, reproducibility and variety extend the current model for coronavirus gene expression. The capability of coronaviruses to regulate the species and amounts of noncanonical transcripts may contribute to the pathogenesis of coronavirus during infection. The identification of the biological characteristics of noncanonical coronavirus transcripts may assist the coronavirus research community in answering previously unanswered questions on coronavirus gene expression and pathogenesis and provide a database for a variety of biomedical studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
