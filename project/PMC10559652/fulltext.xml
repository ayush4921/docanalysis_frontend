Media literacy skills can cope with their own media activities and expose themselves intentionally to the media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, examining the results of meta-analysis investigations of the effectiveness of educational media literacy interventions on the avoidance of performances with high risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] presents the facts of the need to implement health interventions to promote media literacy In Iran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>A focus on media literacy related to coronavirus</title><p id="Par8">Coronavirus (COVID-19) has been hotly discussed worldwide since January 30, 2020, as an international public health concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. During this period, the youth are confined in their homes in particular situations, and many use social media apps for entertainment. These new opportunities facilitate access to a large body of information for learning and social interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] while exposing them to dangerous individuals, including those with physical and mental health disorders. Based on several surveys, compulsive media use can be represented as an environmental risk factor for youth&#x02019;s health, including having a sedentary lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or lower life satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], anxiety, sleep disturbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Also, concerning all the draconian measures for the prevention of COVID-19, enabling individuals with media literacy and critically thinking about reports of media, truth or not true, and act using all forms of communication related to COVID-19 and have independent individual decision-making without interference from other environmental factors (media contents) to prevent the coronavirus disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] is essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Adopted theoretical framework of C-19MLs</title><p id="Par10">In addition, there is a global need to study individuals&#x02019; health-specific media literacy competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], especially on specific pandemic issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. On the other hand, one globally critical need, consultation, and recommendation for further action by the World Health Organization (WHO) and &#x0201d;a key component of the COVID-19 global response&#x0201d; is increasing COVID-19 infodemic management in individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To validate a measure of COVID-19 Media Literacy (C-19ML), applying an appropriate conceptual framework to evaluate the effectiveness of media literacy tools and the designed interventions is necessary. In this regard, the Media Literacy Training Center of the American CML (Theory CML Media Lit Kit) conceptual framework was selected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which is presented as a promising tool and evaluates the effectiveness of media literacy interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Based on this framework, media literacy has five domains: &#x0201c;purpose, constructedness, audience, format, filter, and omit&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Purpose means most media messages are organized to gain profit and power; &#x0201c;Why is this message being sent?&#x0201c;. The meaning of contractedness is that all media messages are constructedness;&#x0201c; Who created this message?&#x0201c;. Audience means different people experience the same media message differently; &#x0201c;How might different people understand this message differently from me?&#x0201c;. Format and filter mean media messages are constructed using a language with its rules; &#x0201c;What creative techniques are used to attract my attention?&#x0201c;. The meaning of omitting is that media have embedded value and point of view; &#x0201c;What lifestyle, value and point of view are presented in or omitted from this message?&#x0201d;. These dimensions are the five core concepts of the selected framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Notably, this framework was used in other and near the scope of the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Hence, the current study aimed to assess the psychometric features of C-19ML for measuring the youth&#x02019;s C-19ML.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Existing instruments and gaps</title><p id="Par12">Several general and specific tools measure media literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Each of these tools has introduced dimensions for media literacy (ML). These tools suffer from their narrow scopes and lack of tools targeted at measuring ML in specific issues to assess media literacy comprehensively in multidimensional skills. Moreover, the multidimensional specific media literacy to measure media literacy has mainly been neglected. For example, Chen et al. argue that media literacy is both an understanding producer and a consumer of media content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Buckingham et al. emphasized functional and critical literacy, which define functional media literacy as competencies tools for critical thinking about creator media messages and understanding them at the textual level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">In contrast, critical media literacy is the ability to analyze and judge media messages and understand them at various contextual levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. So, these notions about media literacy are traditional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Recently, Li X et al. went beyond and developed a study to construct digital skills scales for primary and middle school children, especially in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, the number of studies proposing a tool to operationalize media literacy related to emerging diseases is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although some studies have been conducted using the researcher-made questionnaire about media literacy in Iran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], no prior research has psychometrically evaluated the C-19ML skills in individuals.</p><p id="Par15">Also, several organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, European Commission, UNESCO, and European Parliament and several media organizations such as Center for Media Literacy (CML), National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE), and Association for Media Literacy (AML) have vigorously discussed the media literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Because no scale exists that measures the C-19 media literacy concepts in the student populations, the concept analysis process begins with exploring COVID-19 media literacy through interviews with people familiar with this concept and personal experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

</p><p id="Par20">Based on the results of the previous qualitative study, the concept identification and concept analysis process was done concerning the appearance of new media technology along with emerging diseases, critical thinking about new concepts such as creators of media massages, methods of persuading the audience by creators of media messages and presented/ omit new patterns in lifestyle by misinformation and fake news were identified. So, generally, five concepts or factors consisting of (a) purpose, (b) contractedness, (c) audience, (d) format, and (e) filter and omit were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Then, the items were completed by creating a matrix that visually displays the content to be addressed by the items and the dimensions of the concept that would be measured. This matrix helped the researcher identify the number and type of items required to measure the concept adequately. However, for the phrasing of items, the researcher turns to qualitative interviews with people familiar with this concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Results of the previous study showed that dimensions were required to adequately measure these concepts with the increased number of items of format and technique (8 items) and lifestyles represented in fake media coronavirus messages (8 items).

That is, C-19MLs is a specific measuring scale in media literacy, and until now, there aren&#x02019;t specific media literacy scales for measuring individuals.</p><p id="Par78">The present study&#x02019;s finding examined the external validity, in which all dimensions were different among marital status and gender., mean scores of all dimensions in married students were higher than in singles. Chang et al.&#x02018;s study noted an increase in parents&#x02019; search for medical information and an increase in e-health literacy, which could be consistent with the present study&#x02019;s findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Also, previous evidence found gender differences in computer and information literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Notably, studies recommend that boys and girls may perform differently on computer and information literacy skills, and these skills require learning in higher competencies, especially in emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Reliability</title><p id="Par79">The reliability represents the stableness and consistency of an instrument&#x02019;s constructs, indicating the questionnaire&#x02019;s measuring accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The last 21-item scale possesses an excellent internal consistency, with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.86, indicating the acceptable reliability of the suggested questionnaires. Primack et al. performed a study with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.87; the last scale with 18 items had exceptional internal consistency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Ashrafi-rizi et al. (2014), investigating the Media Literacy Scale, reported satisfactory reliability with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.89 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p><p id="Par80">Though the ICC level was desired in all domain structures, that means satisfactory quantities of ICC; nevertheless, an excellent internal consistency existed between these domain structures with a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.89. Thus, it is suggested to consider this fact in approaching studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>The strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par81">Regardless of some strength in our investigation, such as compared with previous tools, the newly developed C-19MLs is a multidimensional specific media literacy scale related to emerging diseases.</p><p id="Par82">Also, this scale focuses on specific media literacy in developing countries among college students. On the other hand, other scales of ML emphasize that media literacy is both an understanding producer and a consumer of media content, or media literacy is generally managing consuming media, which these notions are traditional.</p><p id="Par83">Also, with the appearance of new media technology along with emerging diseases, critical thinking about new dimensions such as creators of media massages, methods of persuading the audience by creators of media massages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], and presenting/omitting new patterns in lifestyle by misinformation and fake news [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] could be useful; because these typologies of information can play an essential role in teaching proper health information-seeking behavior when facing with the crises which in other scales to be neglected.</p><p id="Par84">Some limitations exist likewise; first, this work was conducted by a student of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, which suggested future studies could be conducted in other areas or countries to test the external validity.</p><p id="Par85">Second, it&#x02019;s impractical to ensure the utilization of the conclusions to the populations in numerous geographical areas or another context because this scale measures COVID-19 media literacy in developing countries. So, it could be validated in future studies in developed countries. Thirdly, we deleted the items based on EFA results; therefore, we suggested adding additional items in future studies.</p><p id="Par86">Also, future studies must compare studies about C-19MLs in students after and before COVID-19 and during seasonal influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par87">Concisely, C-19MLs is a scale with reliability and validity for evaluating COVID-19 media literacy among students. Validation assessments with various longitudinal designs and populations should be vitally aimed at purifying, adjusting, or confirming the C-19MLs as an additional, complementary media literacy (ML) tool. Moreover, suggestions for future work in defining and assessing the field of health investigation and media literacy. This indicates the significance for educators and stakeholders to realize the vital participating individuals in the new media ecology and new &#x02018;Infomedia&#x02019; ecosystems for empowering people, especially in online health information searches in the youth. Also, this scale could be applied for designing interventional strategies, particularly in cyberchondria, &#x0201c;digital syndrome&#x0201d; prevention in societies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec38"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>
