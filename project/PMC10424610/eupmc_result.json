calls for the development of pan-HCoV therapeutics and vaccines. This study reports the design and engineering of a recombinant protein designated HR1LS. It contains three linked molecules, each consisting of three structural domains, including a heptad repeat 1 (HR1), a central helix (CH), and a stem helix (SH) region, in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. It was found that HR1LS protein automatically formed a trimer able to bind with heptad repeat 2 (HR2) region in the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit, thus potently inhibiting HCoV fusion and entry into host cells. Furthermore, immunization of mice with HR1LS, when combined with CF501 adjuvant, resulted in the production of neutralizing antibodies against infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, as well as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and MjHKU4r-CoV-1. These results suggest that HR1LS is a promising candidate for further development as a novel HR1-trimer-based pan-HCoV entry inhibitor or vaccine for the treatment and prevention of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, but also other HCoVs with the potential to cause future emerging and re-emerging infectious coronavirus diseases.", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE/NHC/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Infectious Disease and Biosecurity, Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of Pathogenic Microbes and Infection, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "ZD2021CY001", "agency": "Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project", "orderIn": "0"}, {"agency": "the National Key R&amp;D Program of China", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "20XD1420300", "agency": "Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research", "orderIn": "0"}, {"agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Animals"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Mice"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Coronavirus 229E, Human", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "COVID-19", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "PC", "qualifierName": "prevention & control", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Vaccine", "Coronavirus", "Entry Inhibitor", "Stem Helix", "Pan-human Coronavirus"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": [{"name": "Recombinant Proteins", "registryNumber": "0"}, {"name": "Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus", "registryNumber": "0"}, {"name": "spike protein, SARS-CoV-2", "registryNumber": "0"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2023.2244084"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10424610"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10424610?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by-nc", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "pdb"}, "dateOfCompletion": "2023-08-14", "dateOfCreation": "2023-08-03", "firstIndexDate": "2023-08-04", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2023-08-21", "dateOfRevision": "2023-08-16", "firstPublicationDate": "2023-12-01"}
